**Materials for a Sonic Pi workshop for complete beginners**

Worksheet and starter tunes for a workshop at one of [Glasgow Science Centre](https://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/)'s "Lates" events.  Participants started with a series of buffers containing well known tunes, which they modified according to the instructions on the worksheet.  

The second half of the workshop involved the participants taking it in turn to make a single change to a starting piece of code, playing out loud, to produce a "mini-Algorave".  This is know as "Mexican Roulette" in [Algorave](https://algorave.com/) circles and is described in more detail on page 163 of [this document](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fea7/6136a02dcd119a0217bf9322dd22901f9b09.pdf)
